## Description

My final project is a side scrolling platform using pygame. This game features a player character that must make it to the finish line by avoiding obstacles with jumping. I began this project by following a tutorial that helped me set up the basic functionality, then was able to build my own features on top. 

There are a lot of placeholder assets in the folder from the tutorial. This included any art assets from the tutorial as well as art for any extra features I wanted to design. My extra features in the game included a health system for the player, a fruit object that would partially heal the player, a trampoline object that would boost the player, a game over/death screen and a win screen. 

Some of the bigger challenges I faced when creating these features were figuring out collisions with the new objects I created, how I would define game over versus winning, and getting the health ui to not overlap with the ending screens. If I were to continue this project, I would want to refine the ending screens to have a restart function and clean up the health ui. I would also like to design my own art assets to make it more personal.

Overall, I feel very proud of both being able to follow along with the tutorial as well as create my own features based on what I learned. I could start to feel myself remembering how class and function setups worked and being able to figure out issues without as much hand holding. I also really like the features I made, I feel like they add to the gameplay in a meaningful way and make it feel more like a game then just a gameplay test.
